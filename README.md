# Enfuse for Gimp

## Description

This plugin allows you to create a HDR image without leaving Gimp.

Just create one layer for each exposure, call the plugin and a new layer will be added to your current image with the blend result.

## Requirements

* [Gimp 2.8](https://www.gimp.org/)
* [Enfuse 4.2](http://enblend.sourceforge.net/)
* Windows PC

## Acknowledgements

This plugin was the original idea of Fernando Batista, a great friend and photographer and he's helping me testing and providing feedback and new ideas.

This is my first Gimp plugin and Python script so these resources got me through it.
Thanks!
